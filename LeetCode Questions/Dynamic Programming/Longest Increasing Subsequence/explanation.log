Problem:
    Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

Solution:
    Create a DP array, same length as the input array.
    This will be the longest increasing subsequence at that index, they will all be initilized to 1
    Use I and J pointers

    dpArr = 1 for len nums
    currentMax = 1
    for j = 1 < len array 
        for i = 0 < j
            nums[j] grater than nums[i]?
                dpArr[j] = max of dpArr[i] + 1 or dpArr[j]
        currentMax = max of currentMax and dpArr[j]

    time: O(n ^ 2) we do up to n work for all n elements. Two for loops
    Space: O(n) store the DP array
