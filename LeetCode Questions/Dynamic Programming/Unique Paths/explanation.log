Problem:
    A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid
    The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid 
    How many possible unique paths are there?

Solution:
    Create a DP matrix with the size m x n, first row and col are all ones because there's only one way to get there
    Add numbers from the cell above and the cell to the left to get the current number of paths
    Fill the matrix in till you get to the bottom right

    Time: O(n x m) because it needs to loop through the entire matrix
    Space: O(n x m) because it depends on the size of the matrix
