Problem:
    Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
    Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
    Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

Solution:
    Create a second DP array that has true or false values to see if that element can be reached or not.
    Create a I and J variable as pointers
    If it's possible to reach the Ith step, AND the Ith step can jump to the Jth step, set the J'th steps DP value to true on the second array
    Else, keep the Jth step DP value as false
    Return the last value in the DP array to see if the last step is reachable

    Time: O(n ^ 2) because of two nested loops

    Space: O(n) because of the DP array with the same size as the input
