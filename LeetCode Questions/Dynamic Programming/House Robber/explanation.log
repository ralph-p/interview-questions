Problem:
    You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, 
    the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and 
    it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
    Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house,
    determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Solution:
    if it's just one house, return that house
    If it's two, return the max number
    Max loot at Nth house:
        Loot at Nth house + loot from Nth - 2 house
        OR
        Max loot from Nth - 1 house

    Time: O(n) since it needs to go through the array at least once
    Space: O(n) but it can be O(c) if we use two variables instead of an array to store the values
