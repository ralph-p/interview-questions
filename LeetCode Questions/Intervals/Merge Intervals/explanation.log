Problem #56:
    Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

    Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
    Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
    Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Solution:
    Sort all intervals by their starting value from least to gratest
    Create a results array
    Push the first value to the results array
    Loop through the sorted intervals, if there are any overlapping values update the elements in the results array

    Time: O(N log N) since we sort the arrays
    Space: O(C) we sort the input array in place
