Problem:
    Given an array of meeting time intervals [start,finish] determine if a person could attend all the meetings

Solution:
    Put the start and end times in two seperate sorted arrays
    for index = 1 < startsArr - 1:
        if startsArr[index + 1] < endArr[index]:
            return false
    
    Time: O(N log N) because of sorting
    Space: O(n) because of the starts and ends array
