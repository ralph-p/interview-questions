Problem:
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Solution:
Use the sliding window technique to keep track of the max length. This will complete in O(n) time
    create an empty hashMap(key/val -> character/index)
    create a starting point and a max length, both set to zero

    for each character in string:
        if character is in the Hashmap and the index is >= the start:
            Set start to the index found in the hashMap + 1
        set the hashMap to the current character/index 
        if current max length is less than current window set it to the current window

    return max
