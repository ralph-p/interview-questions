Problem:
    Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

Solution:
    compare lengths of both string, if they're not the same return false
    create empty hash table
    loop through the first string:
        map all the letters to the hash table, counting the number of letters
    loop through the second string:
        if the letter isn't in the hash table
            return false
        if the letter is in the hashtable and it's greater than zero, decrease the letter count in the hash table 
    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(1) the hash table will have 26 key-value pairs at the most
