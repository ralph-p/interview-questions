Question:
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Solution:

create empty stack

for char in string:
    if it's an open bracket 
        push to stack
    else if  pop the stack & it's not the same as char
        return false 

return true if the length of the stack is zero, false if not

Time is O(n)
