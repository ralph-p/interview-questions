Problem:
Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

Solution:
    Words that are anagrams of each other will be the same word if their letters are sorted Alphabetically 
    So to solve this, sort each word and compare them

    Time: O(N K log K) where N is the number of Strings and K is the length of strings
    Space: O(N K) data is stored in the grouped hash table
