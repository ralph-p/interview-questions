Problem:
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Solution:
    Each sequence of letters is a half mirror of each other
    Works for both even and odd characters

    create left and right pointer, one for the start and one for the end of the string
    If the left and right match, move the pointers in one character. 
    If they don't match it's not a palindrome

    Time: O(n)
    Space: O(1) left and right pointers take up constant space
