Problem:
    Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
Solution:
    create a dummy head node
    create a current pointer, pointing to which ever linked list has the smaller head variable. 
    Then just check each linked list and point dummy head next to the smaller of the two
Time: O(n + m) where N and M are lengths of the Linked lists
Space: O(c) we always use three nodes regardless of the size of the Linked List
