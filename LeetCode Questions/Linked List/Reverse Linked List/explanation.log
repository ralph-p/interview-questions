Problem:
    Reverse a singly linked list.

Solution:
    Create a Prev and current variable. 
    Prev = Null
    Current = head of LL

    loop through the LL
        Make current node.next point to Prev
        move them both up by 1
Time: O(n) we go through the LL at least once
Space: O(c) we are only using a previous and current pointer
